		aboutBody: "Survival of the Best Fit is a game to demonstrates how careless use of AI in hiring further perpetuates existing human bias. In this simulation, the users will play the role of recruiters at a fast-growth company. To reduce costs and maximize output, they would use a new, obscure AI system to replace human recruiters, only to realize that this creates a snowball of problems.\nThis is a project by Gabor Csapo, Jihyun Kim, Miha Klasinc, and Alia ElKattan"
