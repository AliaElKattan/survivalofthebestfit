First, download and install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) (npm comes with node).

You can check by running the following in the terminal. If it responds with version number, it's already installed.

```bash
node -v
```

Next, install the javascript dependencies for this project by opening the terminal `cd`ing to this directory and running `npm install`. Hint: You can type `cd` and then drag the directory to the terminal window, and it'll paste the path there, so you can just hit enter.

Once that's done, run

```bash
npm start
```

And go to [`http://localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234) in your browser or [click here](http://localhost:1234)
